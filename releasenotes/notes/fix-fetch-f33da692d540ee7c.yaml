    Fix: Fetch URL extract too many matched directories
    When `fetch` url is used, restraint is copying anything that
    matches the pattern in `https://<snip>#pattern` regardless
    of the location in the received path.  If pattern is `include`,
    both `general/include, include` directories will match
    when it should only be `include`.  Restraint will
    now only select if it matches starting from beginning 
    of received path NOT throughout directory path. But first,
    the first `string/` must be ignored from the received
    path since it is superfluous for the match since it
    includes the repo and branch name added by curl.
    Jobs that include this repo-branch prefix in the
    fetch pattern will now fail with this changeset.
    So fetching `https://<snip>#repo-branch/pattern`
    will fail.
