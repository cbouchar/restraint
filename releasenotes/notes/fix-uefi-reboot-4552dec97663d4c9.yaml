    Fix: rstrnt-reboot not reliable for UEFI systems
    When `efibootmgr` is present, the `NextBoot` variable is set to reboot
    to `Current`.  When `rstrnt-prepare-reboot` was written, a timer was set
    to remove `NextBoot` setting after 180 seconds. `rstrnt-reboot`
    uses the `prepare` script and the timer wasn't long enough and not
    needed for `rstrnt-reboot`. This changeset allows `NEXTBOOT_VALID_TIME`
    to be set to 0.  When 0, the timer is not set and as a result
    `NextBoot` will not be removed. `rstrnt-reboot` now uses a 0 timer.
